        <p>How do systems make a city? This course will explore how a city is composed of complex interactions of urban systems, ranging from infrastructure and transportation networks to social, cultural and political systems. Students will be introduced to the concept of the city as a “system of systems” and the needs of users operating and interacting within such systems. The course will also offer a broad perspective on pressing urban challenges such as sustainability, resiliency, and equity. A special focus will be on emerging technologies such as IoT and Big Data and their practical applications to tackle such challenges. Students will gain knowledge of how to model systems to support useful simulations and build solutions. In addition, students will develop strategies that can transform cities and improve urban life. The course will consist of a combination of classic texts and contemporary readings, case studies, site visits, hands-on assignments, team-oriented projects, and visiting lectures by leading urban practitioners.</p>
        <h1>Course Requirements</h1>
        <p>This course will require weekly readings, active participation in class discussions, three individual assignments and a five-part group project. Readings will focus on selections of state- of-the-art research on urban systems and past and contemporary precedents. Students will be required to submit questions regarding each weekly reading; these questions will form the basis for discussions in class.</p>
        <p>In addition to readings, students will be required to submit three individual assignments uploaded to Canvas and shared with peers, these will include identifying, analyzing and representing a hard and soft system, analyzing and representing the relationship between hard and soft systems and measuring and evaluating the impact of an urban system on the environment.</p>
        <p>The final project will be a semester-long group project that develops a comprehensive strategy to reopen a city after a pandemic. Covering (1) Approach to the reopening offices, construction and manufacturing (2) Approach to the reopening of schools and universities (3) Approach to the reopening of shops and restaurants (4) Approach to the reopening of cultural and recreational facilities (5) Overall reopening strategy</p>
        <p>Students are encouraged to participate in occasional site visits to observe urban systems in action and meet their operators.</p>
