        <p>How do systems make a city? This course will explore how a city is composed of complex interactions of urban systems, ranging from infrastructure and transportation networks to social, cultural and political systems. Students will be introduced to the concept of the city as a “system of systems” and the needs of users operating and interacting within such systems. The course will also offer a broad perspective on pressing urban challenges such as sustainability, resiliency, and equity. A special focus will be on emerging technologies such as IoT and Big Data and their practical applications to tackle such challenges. Students will gain knowledge of how to model systems to support useful simulations and build solutions. In addition, students will develop strategies that can transform cities and improve urban life. The course will consist of a combination of classic texts and contemporary readings, case studies, site visits, hands-on assignments, team-oriented projects, and visiting lectures by leading urban practitioners.</p>
        <h1>Course Requirements</h1>
        <p>This course will require weekly readings, active participation in class discussions, three individual assignments and a five-part group project. Readings will focus on selections of state- of-the-art research on urban systems and past and contemporary precedents. Students will be required to submit questions regarding each weekly reading; these questions will form the basis for discussions in class.</p>
        <p>In addition to readings, students will be required to submit three individual assignments uploaded to Canvas and shared with peers, these will include identifying, analyzing and representing a hard and soft system, analyzing and representing the relationship between hard and soft systems and measuring and evaluating the impact of an urban system on the environment.</p>
        <p>The final project will be a semester-long group project that develops a comprehensive strategy to reopen a city after a pandemic. Covering (1) Approach to the reopening offices, construction and manufacturing (2) Approach to the reopening of schools and universities (3) Approach to the reopening of shops and restaurants (4) Approach to the reopening of cultural and recreational facilities (5) Overall reopening strategy</p>
        <p>Students are encouraged to participate in occasional site visits to observe urban systems in action and meet their operators.</p>

        <h1>Academic integrity</h1>
        <p>Each student in this course is expected to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity. Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. The policy can be found on the university’s website here:<a href=https://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/academic-integrity>Academic Integrity</a></p>
        <p>You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a diskette, or a hard copy.</p>
        <p>Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.</p>
        <p>During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during the examinations will result in failure of the exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.</p>
        <h3>Students with disabilities</h3>
        <p>Your access in this course is important. Please give me [the TA, the Course Coordinator] your Student Disability Services (SDS) accommodation letter early in the semester so that we have adequate time to arrange your approved academic accommodations. If you need an immediate accommodation for equal access, please speak with me after class or send an email message to me and/or SDS at sds_cu@cornell.edu. If the need arises for additional accommodations during the semester, please contact SDS. You may also feel free to speak with Student Services at Cornell Tech who will connect you with the university SDS office.</p>
        <h3>Religious observances</h3>
        <p>Cornell University is committed to supporting students who wish to practice their religious beliefs. Students are advised to discuss religious absences with their instructors well in advance of the religious holiday so that arrangements for making up work can be resolved before the absence.</p>
        <h3>Our supportive community</h3>
        <p><b>Cornell Tech Cares:</b> The Cornell Tech community is a diverse and vibrant group of students, faculty, and staff. We take our responsibility to look out for one another seriously. As members of this community, your openness and proactive communication will allow us all to better care for students and respond to their needs, whether they be interpersonal or academic. Please help us continue to build and strengthen our community by reaching out if you are having an issue or are concerned about a fellow student. Contact studentwellness@tech.cornell.edu with concerns and we will make sure to care for one another. In the event of an emergency, please call 911 and Cornell Tech Safety & Security at 646-971-3611 (This number is also located on the back of your Cornell ID), when safe to do so.
